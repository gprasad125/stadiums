## Literature Review
There has been work done previously to analyze the location of sports stadiums; however, the vast majority of this research has been about the economic causes and impacts these locations have on the nearby communities. Little substantial research has been conducted in specific to the topic of 'food options' around sporting stadiums. Nonetheless, looking at the available literature is an important step to contextualizing our work and setting a baseline.

A few research publications in this vein include:

#### *Localized economic impact of sports stadium construction*
Scott Sommers, University of Richmond

Here, the researcher discusses how the building of sports stadiums has a tangible economic impact on the creation and maintenance of local businesses in the surrounding area. With respect to restaurants, which is relevant to our question, the paper found that building a stadium can increase the number of nearby restaurants by nearly 10. Stadiums attract tourism and high publicity, and obviously restaurants would also benefit from this. Furthermore, we would expect to see generally high price restaurants to attract those leaving the stadium after games rather.

#### *How Location Matters in Restaurant Success?*
Xiangbin Yang & Jing Wang, Pacific Asian Conference on Information Systems

Here, the researchers discuss how the location of a restaurant has a significant impact on its economic success. They conclude that restaurant that locate themselves in “hot” areas of high societal and cultural activity have greater success than others; while the restaurants were chosen from China, the overall conclusion should reflect in the diversity of restaurants around stadiums.

#### *Availability and marketing of food and beverages to children through sports settings: a systematic review*
Mary-Ann Carter, R Edwards, L Signal & J Hoek, Cambridge University Press

The paper provides information on the physical, economic, and political environments surrounding food and beverage sponsorship and promotion in sports settings. The authors found that food and beverage sponsorship is prevalent, particularly by unhealthy food and beverage companies, and that there is a need for healthier food options. The findings suggest that the types of food available at sports stadiums in the US should be examined to see if they align with the nutritional recommendations for children.

#### *Alcohol Control Policies and Practices at Professional Sports Stadiums*
Kathleen M. Lenk, Traci L. Toomey, Darin J. Erickson, Gunna R. Kilian, Toben F. Nelson, & Lindsey E.A. Fabian, Public Health Reports

This paper reveals that alcohol policies in U.S. sporting stadiums have a fairly-high level of inconsistency across the country with respect to who can serve alcohol, but many do enforce limitations on amount. While the focus is on food consumption *inside* the stadium, the results still are pertinent to our research. Specifically, we would expect to see many restaurants with tags that specify they can serve alcohol so that patrons can overcome limitations enforced by stadiums.
